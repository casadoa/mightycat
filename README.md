# MIGHTYCAT INC PEST CONTROL
## MIGHTYCATINC.COM


### My name is Andres Casado and this is a website I made for a former employer to practice my web developement skills
### This is a simple pest control website.


**Programming Languages included in this site are**
* HTML5
* CSS
* PHP

A couple things about the site is that they include
1. Datasheets to show chemicals used and a link to their chemical page.
2. A contact page to possibly schedule a visit with a potential client.

**Why PHP was chosen**

At first I thought I would be able to write a simple contact.html page using a form, but after more understanding there needed to be a little back-end validation. 
And to make sure I could do that PHP was a programming language I chose to be able to use form-validation and properly protect against malicious users. Allowing for 
me to make a form and send to an email.
